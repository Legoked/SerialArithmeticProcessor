Serial arithmetic processors are a type of processor that performs operations on data one bit at a time, rather than processing multiple bits simultaneously like parallel processors. In this particular project, the design that is being constructed has specifications that would allow the user to perform a set of operations on a 4-bit operation code --- OpCode. The design consits of three main modules; a data path, state generator, and a control circuit. These three modules will work in conjunction to output a 4-bit result.

 \subsection*{DATAPATH Module}
 \paragraph*{ALU Function Set}This particular module specifications include two registers that corresponds to one 4-digit bit. These registers have control inputs \textbf{s1rA} and \textbf{s0rA} for register A, and \textbf{s1rB} \textbf{s0rB} for register B. These registers sport a 74194 chip that are used as shift/parallel load registers. Towards the center of the diagram is where the single 2:1 input processor multiplexer is located. The bottom right portion of the diagram features the carry portion of the full adder (which is located towards the left of item labeled \textbf{CARRY MUX}).
 \paragraph*{}In addition to the hardware, the module also includes inputs which are employed in hopes of inputting the proper configuration for the machine once it is ``powered on''. Note that the machine is also configured with asynchronous active-low reset (\textbf{rst} as seen in the diagram) CLK is simply the clock input meant to keep track of the different stages the machine may be in during its operation. \textbf{CS} and \textbf{CSEL} represent the carry MUX selector bits and the carry enable respectively.

Note that the outputs for $x_i$ and $y_i$ each represent the 4-bit value for A and B; which make up the two integers whom of which are being operated on.

 \subsection*{Stage Generator}
  \paragraph*{State Diagram}
  As stated prior, this machine is configured to have an asynchronous reset; in doing so, the machine needs to be able to decide what operations it must be accomplishing. Figure 2 depicts an interpretation of the ASM chart of the serial arithmetic processor. The diagram depicts the different states that the machine may undergo during its operation. Note the implicit timing information that is denoted by box which indicates exactly what operation the machine is undergoing during said state (denoted by $T_i$ where $i$ represents a state from 1-5).

      State diagram for the serial arithmetic prossesor. The ASM for this machine can be summed up in the following sentences:
      Hold in the initial state (T0) until \textbf{START} is set to 1. Move through the remaining 5 states and return to $T0$ when completed. The value of \textbf{START} does not matter while in states 1-4. The system will pause in $T5$ if \textbf{START} is left at 1, and will only return to $T0$ if \textbf{START} = 0. Asynchronously return to the initial state (T0) when the system \textbf{RESET} is ‘0’

  \subsection*{Control Circuit}

   The last module that must be configured for this machine is the control circuit. The purpose behind this module is it is essentially a ccombinational circuit whose inputs sets the control signals; these signals are based on the PS and current inputs.

  \paragraph*{Control Circuit \& APU Circuit} Prior to constructing the block diagram, formulas must be derived once more from its respective table Note that the formulas for CE, s0rB, and s1rB, CSEL are shared respectively. This makes sense as if you locate the outputs on the control circuit truth table, depend on what values you set the Don't Cares to, you can have the same outputs.
  \begin{equation}
    s1rA = T_0 \cdot START \hspace{20pt} \overline{s0rA} = (T_0 \cdot \overline{START}) + T_1 + (T_5 \cdot START)
