# Serial Arithmetic Processor Project Report

This repository documents the design, implementation, and testing of a serial arithmetic processor developed for a digital logic course. 

**Project Overview**

The serial arithmetic processor is capable of performing the following operations on binary numbers:

*   Addition
*   Subtraction
*   Multiplication
*   Division

Input and output are handled serially (one bit at a time).

**Project Stages**

This project was developed in the following iterative stages:

1.  **Conceptual Design:** Development of high-level block diagrams, system requirements, and operational specifications.
2.  **Component Design:** Detailed design of individual components (registers, arithmetic logic unit, control unit, etc.) using logic gates and Boolean expressions.
3.  **Simulation:**  Verification of component and system functionality using a digital logic simulator.
4.  **Hardware Implementation (Optional):** If applicable, building the circuit on a breadboard or FPGA for physical testing.

**Repository Structure**

*   **design/:** Contains design documents, schematics, block diagrams, and simulation files.
*   **reports/:** Includes progress reports, design analysis documents, and the final project report.
*   **test/:**  Contains test cases, simulation results, and analysis of test coverage.
*   **implementation/ (Optional):** Contains Verilog/VHDL code if a hardware implementation was completed.

**Important Note**

This repository is intended for documentation and demonstration purposes. The code or design files may not be directly usable for building a functional serial arithmetic processor.
